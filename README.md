* Task tracking for current Pomodoro session (Optional)
* Minimalist and user-friendly interface

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* Node.js and npm (if it's a Node.js project, which seems likely from `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in your screenshot)

```bash
# Example for Node.js if you haven't listed specific instructions yet
npm install

Installing

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone [https://github.com/rawr234/pomodoro-timer.git](https://github.com/rawr234/pomodoro-timer.git)

Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd pomodoro-timer

Install dependencies (if applicable, using the command from Prerequisites):
Bash

npm install

Run the application (You'll need to specify how to run it. For example, if it's a simple web app, it might be opening index.html, or if it uses a development server):
Bash

    # Example: npm start
    # Or: Open index.html in your browser

üõ†Ô∏è Built With

    HTML5
    CSS3
    JavaScript
    (Mention any frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or libraries like Electron if you used them. From your file list, it seems like a vanilla JS, HTML, CSS project, possibly with Electron given preload.js and main.js which are common in Electron apps.)

**How to use this template:**

1.  **Copy the text** above.
2.  **Paste it** into your `README.md` file in your project.
3.  **Replace the `` comments** and placeholder text with information specific to your `pomodoro-timer`.
4.  **Review and customize** it further to best represent your project. For example, if you have a live demo, add a link to it!

**Key things to update from the template for *your* project:**

* **Project Description:** Make it compelling.
* **Features:** Be specific about what your timer can do.
* **Prerequisites & Installation:** Your screenshot shows `package.json`, `main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`. This strongly suggests a Node.js and possibly an Electron project.
    * If it's an Electron app, you'll want to include instructions on how to build and run it (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run build`).
    * If it's just a web app, opening `index.html` might be sufficient.
* **Built With:** Be accurate. If you are using Electron, definitely list it.
* **License:** The screenshot says "BSL-1.0 license" next to README, so the Boost Software License 1.0 is likely correct. Ensure your `https://www.google.com/search?q=LICENSE` file contains the full text of this license.
* **Screenshots/GIFs:** Visuals can greatly enhance your README. Consider adding a screenshot or a short GIF of your timer in action.
